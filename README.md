This project is a fork of [this](https://github.com/tahmidefaz/gif-bot) repo and includes the original license.


## Requirements

- Python 3 virtual environment


## Installation

It is usually best-practice in Python projects to install into a sandboxed _virtual environment_, which is set to a specific Python version and contains on the packages you install into it so that your Python projects do not get affected.

Follow this guide to [Setup a Python 3 Virtual Environment](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/3a4d14ba1763b4d6a1884f56a01412b7). 
 
Walk through the Python file and finish all the TODOs. Obtain all the API keys from GIPHY and Twitter and you are good to go!
